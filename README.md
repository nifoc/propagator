## Status

This is alpha software. Things might still change in ways that break everything.

## Usage

**While `pg2` is used internally, having groups span multiple nodes is not supported.**

### Working with groups

```erlang
ok = propagator:create(demo),
AllGroups = propagator:groups(), % => [demo]
ok = propagator:delete(demo),
false = propagator:is_group(demo).
```

In order to subscribe to a group, it has to be created first. This can be done using the `propagator:create/1` method. If at any point you need to remove a group again, you do that using `propagator:delete/1`.

You can check if a process is subscribed to a group using `propagator:is_subscriber/2` and get a list of all subscribers by calling `propagator:subscribers/1`.

```erlang
IsSubscriber = propagator:is_subscriber(demo, self()), % => true | false
Subscribers = propagator:subscribers(demo). % => [â€¦]
```

You can get some basic statistics about a group by calling `propagator:statistics/1`.

### Publish/Subscribe

Assuming you have created a group called `demo`, you can subscribe any process to it using `propagator:subscribe/2`. The method `propagator:subscribe/1` also exists to subscribe `self()` to a group.

```erlang
ok = propagator:subscribe(demo).
```

Publishing a message to a group is done by calling `propagator:publish/3`. The publishing process does not need to be subscribed to the group.

```erlang
ok = propagator:publish(demo, some_tag, [{any, data}]).
```

All messages are tagged, so that subscribing processes can easily pattern-match of incoming messages. The third argument can be anything you want.

You can unsubscribe any process using the `propagator:unsubscribe/2` method. `propagator:unsubscribe/1` also exists to remove the subscription of `self()`.

```erlang
ok = propagator:unsubscribe(demo).
```
